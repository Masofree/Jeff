Mojo Pin

It's a song about a dream

Well i'm lying in my bed
The blanket is warm
This body will never be safe from harm
Still feel your hair, black ribbons of coal
Touch my skin to keep me whole

If only you'd come back to me
If you laid at my side
I wouldn't need no Mojo Pin to keep me satisfied

Don't wanna weep for you, I don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow
Black beauty I love you so

Precious, precious silver and gold and pearls in oyster's flesh
Drop down we two to serve and pray to love
Born again from the rhythm screaming down from heaven
Ageless, ageless
I'm there in your arms

Don't wanna weep for you, I don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow
Black beauty I love you so
So, so...

The welts of your scorn, my love, give me more
Send whips of opinion down my back, give me more
Well it's you I've waited my life to see
It's you I've searched so hard for...

Don't wanna weep for you, I don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow
Black beauty I love you so
So, black black black black beauty...

Grace

There's the moon asking to stay
Long enough for the clouds to fly me away
Oh, it's my time coming,
I'm not afraid
Afraid to die

My fading voice sings of love,
But she cries to the clicking of time.
Of time

Wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.
The fire.

And she weeps on my arm
Walking to the bright lights in sorrow
Oh drink a bit of wine
We both might go tomorrow
Oh my love

And the rain is falling,
I believe my time has come
It reminds me of the pain
I might leave
Leave behind

Wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.
The fire.

It reminds me of the pain
I might leave
Leave behind

And I feel them drown my name
So easy to know and forget with this kiss
I'm not afraid to go but it goes so slow

Wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.

Last Goodbye

This is our last goodbye
I hate to feel the love between us die
But it's over
Just hear this and then i'll go
You gave me more to live for
More than you'll ever know

This is our last embrace
Must I dream and always see your face
Why can't we overcome this wall
Well, maybe it's just because i didn't know you at all

Kiss me, please kiss me
But kiss me out of desire, babe, and not consolation
You know it makes me so angry 'cause i know that in time
I'll only make you cry, this is our last goodbye

Did you say 'no, this can't happen to me,'
And did you rush to the phone to call
Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind
Saying maybe you didn't know him at all
You didn't know him at all, oh, you didn't know

Well, the bells out in the church tower chime
Burning clues into this heart of mine
Thinking so hard on her soft eyes and the memories
Offer signs that it's over... it's over

Lover, You Should've Come Over

Looking out the door I see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations as their shoes fill up with water
Maybe I'm too young to keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you're on my mind so you never know

Broken down and hungry for your love with no way to feed it
Where are you tonight, child you know how much I need it
Too young to hold on and too old to just break free and run

Sometimes a man gets carried away, when he feels like he should be having his fun
Much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that really he has no-one

So I'll wait for you and I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return
Oh will I ever learn

Oh lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late

Lonely is the room, the bed is made, the open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one who dreams he had you with him
My body turns and yearns for a sleep that won't ever come

It's never over
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over
All my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her
It's never over
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over
She's a tear that hangs inside my soul forever

But maybe I'm just too young
To keep good love from going wrong

Lover, you should've come over

Well yes I feel too young to hold on
I'm much too old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb, and blind to see the damage I've done

Sweet lover, you should've come over
Oh, love well I'm waiting for you

Lover, you should've come over
It's not too late

Corpus Christi Carol

He bear her off, he bear her down
He bear her into an orchard ground
Lu Li Lu Lay
Lu Li Lu Lay
The falcon hath bourne my mate away

And in this orchard there was a hold
That was hanged with purple and gold
And in that hold there was a bed
And it was hanged with chords of red

Lu Li Lu Lay
Lu Li Lu Lay
The falcon hath bourne my mate away

And on this bed there lyeth a knight
His wound is bleeding day and night
By his bedside kneeleth a maid
And she weepeth both night and day

Lu Li Lu Lay
Lu Li Lu Lay
The falcon hath bourne my mate away

By his bedside standeth a stone
Corpus Christi written thereon

Eternal Life

Eternal Life is now on my trail
Got my red glitter coffin, man, just need one last nail
While all these ugly gentlemen play out their foolish games
there's a flaming red horizon that screams our names
And as your fantasies are broken in two
Did you really think this bloody road
would pave the way for you?
You better turn around
and blow your kiss hello to life eternal, angel

Racist everyman, what have you done?
Man, you've made a killer of your unborn son...
Crown my fear your king at the point of a gun
All I want to do is love everyone...

And as your fantasies are broken in two
did you really think this bloody road
would pave the way for you?
You better turn around
and blow your kiss hello to life eternal

Oh...

There's no time for hatred, only questions
Where is love, where is happiness, what is Life,
where is peace?

When will I find the strength to bring me release?
And tell me where is the love in what your prophet has said?
Man, It sounds to me just like a prison for the walking dead
And I've got a message for you and your twisted hell
You better turn around and blow your kiss goodbye
to life eternal angel...
Angel...

Dream Brother

There is a child sleeping near his twin
The pictures go wild in a rush of wind
That dark angel he is shuffling in
Watching over them with his black feather wings unfurled

The love you lost with her skin so fair
Is free with the wind in her butterscotch hair
Her green eyes blew goodbyes
With her head in her hands
and your kiss on the lips of another
Dream Brother with your tears scattered round the world.

Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine
And nobody ever came...

Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine
And nobody ever came...

Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine
Nobody ever came
Nobody ever...

I feel afraid and I call your name
I love your voice and your dance insane
I hear your words and I know your pain
With your head in your hands and her kiss on the lips of another
Your eyes to the ground and the world spinning round forever
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over

Ah do you meet the one I love
and smell the one who loves you
Dream brother, dream brother, dream, dream
dream asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over

The Sky Is A Landfill

Circle around the park
Joining hands in silence
Watch the evil black the sky

The storm has ripped the shelter
Of illusion from our brow
This power is no mystery to us now.

Leave your spirit genocide
The cancer you won't remove
We cast our funeral rose inside
And bury the need to prove
Our mutilation is to gain from the system

Ooh, turn your head away
From the screen, oh people
It will tell you nothing more
Don't suck the milk of flaccid Bill K.
Public's empty promise
To the people that the public can ignore

This way of life is so devised
To snuff out the mind that moves
Moving with grace the men despise
And women have learned to lose

Throw off your shame or be
a slave to the system

I see you take another drag
One more lost soul to raise your flag
The sky is a landfill
I see you take another drag
Let's see you take another drag

You like to dance to the rolling
Head of the adulteress
You sing in praise of suicide
We know you're useless
Like cops at the scene of the crime

With your steroids and your feedbag
And your stable and your trainer
I got a mail bomb for you Mister Strong Arm.

Throw out the stones from all the cemetery homes
For the violence of a nation gone by

Or the politics of weakness
And the garbage dump of souls
That will now black the sky

Their yellow haze and crowds of eyes
Will plug up the mind that moves
Moving with grace the men despise
And women have learned to lose
We'll share our bodies
In disdain for the system

Oh, I see you take another drag
One nation bends to kiss the hag
The sky is a landfill
I see you take another drag
I see you take another drag
I have no fear of this machine!

Everybody Here Wants You

Twenty-nine pearls in your kiss
A singing smile
Coffee smell and lilac skin
Your flame in me

Twenty-nine pearls in your kiss
A singing smile
Coffee smell and lilac skin
Your flame in me

I'm only here for this moment

I know everybody here wants you
I know everybody here thinks he needs you
I'll be waiting right here just to show you
How our love will blow it all away

Hmm, such a thing of wonder in this crowd
I'm a stranger in this town
You're free with me
And our eyes locked in downcast love
I sit here proud
Even now you're undressed in your dreams with me

Oh, I'm only here for this moment

I know everybody here wants you
I know everybody here thinks he needs you
I'll be waiting right here just to show you
How our love will blow it all away

I know the tears we cried
Have dried on yesterday
The sea of fools has parted for us
There's nothing in our way
My love

Don't you see, don't you see?
You're just the torch to put the flame to all our guilt and shame
And I'll rise like an ember in your name

I know I, I know I
I know everybody here wants you
I know everybody here thinks he needs you
I'll be waiting right here just to show you
Oh let me show you
That love can rise, rise just like embers

Love can taste like the wine of the ages, oh babe,
And I know they all looks so good from a distance
But I tell you I'm the one

I know everybody here, well, thinks he needs you
Think he needs you
And I'll be waiting right here just to show you.

Opened Once

I once was open
And one with a travelling heart
I loved with disregard

Just like the fiction
Rushing in your riverbed
Arise like applause in my head

And in the half-light
Where we both stand
This is the half-light
See me as I am

Just like the ocean
Always in love with the moon
It's overflowing now
Inside you

We fly right over
The minds of so many in pain
We are the smile of light that brings them rain

In the half light
Where we both stand
In the half light
You saw me as I am

I am a railroad track abandoned
With the sunset
Forgetting
I ever happened
That I ever happened.

Nightmares By The Sea

Beware the bottled thoughts of angry young men
Secret compartments hide all of the skeletons
Little girl wants to make her home with him
In the middle of the shore, she wonders

"Don't know what you asked for."
"Don't know what you asked for."

All young lovers know why
Nightmares blind their mind's eye
Your rube is young and handsome
So new to your bedroom floor
You know damn well where you'll go

I've loved so many times and I've drowned them all
From their coral graves, they rise up when darkness falls
With their bones they'll scratch the window, I hear them call

"Don't know what you asked for."
"Don't know what you asked for."
"Don't know what you asked for."

All young lovers know why
Nightmares blind their mind's eye
Your rube is young and handsome
So new to your bedroom floor
You know damn well where you'll go

Stay with me under these waves, tonight
Be free for once in your life tonight

Your rube is young and handsome
So new to your bedroom floor
You know damn well where you'll go

All young lovers know why
Nightmares blind their mind's eye
Your rube is young and handsome
So new to your bedroom floor
You know damn well where you'll go

All young lovers know why
Nightmares blind their mind's eye
Your rube is young and handsome
So new to your bedroom floor
You know damn well where you'll go.

Yard Of Blonde Girls

Through the yard
Through the yard of blonde girls
Through the river and the sea
Gold sharks glittering
A tree of white
Breaks the earth
The streets where Lola played

Very sexy, very sexy, okay, okay

Fear, we may come
Fear, we may come
Fear, we may come
Fear, we may come
So run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

It's in your heart
It's in your art, your beauty
Even in this world of lies
There's purity
You've got innocence
In your eyes
Even in this world of lies

You're still hopeful
Very sexy, okay, okay

Fear, we may come
Fear, we may come
So run, run, run, run, run, run, run

Through the yard
Through the yard of blonde girls
Through the river and the sea
Gold sharks glittering
A tree of white
Breaks the earth
The streets where Lola played

Very sexy, very sexy, okay, okay

Fear, we may come
Fear, we may come
So run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

Witches' Rave

It sounds just like a scream
I don't know what you mean
Your witchcraft's all around me
In your ragged pagan scene

You tell me all the ways around my garden that you like
I float just like a bubble
Heading for a spike

All is well between the breasts of passenger and slave
We'll never make it out alive to join
The witches' rave

You'd like to see him suffer
For you fantasy and thrill
He fell sick while we made love
He's out there, somewhere, still

Oh I feel the spell that you have cast, hot, pink, nasty
Bubble gum, coming down just like a big red coal

I can't help from looking
Outside for a guarantee
I can't help from looking
Outside for a guarantee

Hey! I try to keep all hidden
When you come around
Oh, no! The sight of broomsticks
Sliding on the ground
You're levitating something
'Cause I feel so collectible

We're all lying natural
He's watching from a window up above
I see he loves you, I'll bring you closer

Something in my fate says it's not right for me
Tell me
Am I cursed or am I blessed?
I can't tell, oh yes!
'Cause all is well between the breasts of
Passenger and slave
I'll never make it out alive to join
The witches' rave

I can't help from looking
Outside for a guarantee
I can't help from looking
Outside for a guarantee
I can't help from looking
Outside for a guarantee
I can't help from looking
Outside for a guarantee
I can't help from looking
Outside for a guarantee
I can't help from looking
Outside for a guarantee
For a guarantee

New Year's Prayer

Oooooo, Fall in light, fall in light. Fall in light, fall in light
Feel no shame for what you are
Feel no shame for what you are
Feel no shame for what you are

As you now are in your blood
Fall in light

Feel no shame for what you are
Feel no shame for what you are
Feel it as a water fall
Fall in light, ooh
Fall in light, fall in light, Fall in light, ooh
Fall in light, fall in light, fall in light
Grow in light

Stand absolved behind your electric chair, dancing
Stand absolved behind your electric chair, dancing
Past the sound within the sound
Past the voice within the voice

Leave your office
Run past your funeral
Leave your home, car
Leave your pulpit
Join us in the streets where we
Join us in the streets where we
Don't belong, don't belong
You and the stars
Throwing light

Ooooooh
Fall, fall
Ooooooh
Fall in light, fall in light. fall in light
Oooooh
Fall in light, fall in light fall in light
Grow in light

Haven't You Heard

Your wish is my command!
Have you heard this talk about eye contact
Gonna be the downfall of this town
First the photographs take you to the right hands
Leads you to the authority mold

Paranoia will write the world prayer
Make sure that you fit in the right holes
But when you take his offer, you're done for
Done for, done for, oooh....

Phantoms in pockets, we're in panic
Making order in total disgust
Oh, they read a list of all who cannot stay
Take you down, on the ground

Paranoia will write this world prayer
Make sure that you fit in the right holes
But when you take his offer, you're done for
Done for, oooh....

Make sure you learn to beware your neighbor
Bolt the doors and hire your guards
Suck your life with their virus called language
Someone told you this all would go down
And the last thing you see is the luster
Hold the razor, goodbye to your friends
Would your underground please call the mayor
Call the neighbor, call your friends

Paranoia will write the world prayer
Make sure that you fit in the right holes
But when you take his offer, you're done for
Done for, done for, oooh....

Well, when he first saw you
You'd need no protection
Eyes trained on your mouth
You'll learn to take him
Hmmm, It's a brand new power, oh

My friends had her questions right
Beware your neighbor
Haven't you heard, haven't you heard
That we're done for. Oh
Learn to beware your neighbor
And the right mode
Haven't you heard?
Haven't you heard
That we're done for, done for ? Oh

When I count down from ten
You'll feel the lead in your lids
You'll have no need to exist
And wake up refreshed.

I Know We Could Be So Happy Baby (If We Wanted To Be)

There's no easy answer
None to blame or forgive
Two cripples dancing
To the end we live

I'm not with you not of you
Not with you, not of you
You are soft and young to me
I am the ghost who comes and goes
And I hope I'll catch you
In the throws of one last look at the wonder
One last look at the wonder

O, God, I love you
And all the past we once knew
Some other love becomes you
Whatever else we come to
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be

You are soft and young to me
I am the ghost who comes and goes
I'm hoping that I'll catch you in the throws
Of one last look at joy that we've become

But there's no easy answer, none to blame or forgive
We were two cripples dancing
To the bitter end we live
I'm not with you, but of you
I'm not with you but of you

O, God, I loved you
And all the past we once knew
Some other love becomes you
Whatever else it comes to
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be

We had a birthplace in common
We had separate beds and lives

I'll just sit here and glow
Break out the oldest pictures
Hand your ruined letters out to dry
We had a birthplace in common
And separate beds and lives
And lives, and lives
I know that we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be
I know that we could be so happy, baby
Yeah oh.

Murder Suicide Meteor Slave

Would you like to meet the villain somewhere
Underneath the skull of a moon
Fire burned his eyes out 'cause his chains are too long for you

Someone has to pay for the damage done
No-one's gonna love you now
Your whole family's splintered
You're a slave to it all now

Oooooh Ahhhhh Oh

You're a slave to it all now
You're a slave
Welcome down to paradise rock
There is no single entrance
With the stars to revolve around
There is no real underground

No stars to revolve around
Here, they're fashioning the noose
Sickened by the knell of the graveyard bell
You know it's not long for you
Sick of all the vomit childhood
Not a trampoline of the freaks
Not even a slave to your father

Oh, you're a slave to it all, now
Oh, you're a slave to it all, now
Welcome down to paradise rock
There is no single entrance
With the stars to revolve around
There is no real underground

There is not single entrance
There's no stars to revolve around
There is no real underground
You're a slave to it all, now.

Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy.

Back In N.Y.C.

I see faces and traces of home back in New York City
So you think I'm a tough kid? Is that what you heard?
Well I like to see some action and it gets into my blood.
They call me the trail blazer - Rael - electric razor
I'm a pitcher in the chain gang, we don't believe in pain only as strong,
'cos we're only as strong, as the weakest link in the chain.
Let me out of Pontiac when I was just seventeen,
I had to get it out of me, if you know what I mean, what I mean.
You say I must be crazy, 'cos I don't care who I hit, who I hit.
But I know it's me thats hittin' out, and I'm, I'm not full of shit.
I don't care who I hurt. I don't care who I do wrong.
This is your mess I'm stuck in, I really don't belong.
When I take out my bottle, filled up high with gasoline,
You can tell by the night fires where Rael has been, has been.

As I cuddled the porcupine
He said I had none to blame, but me.
Held my heart, deep in hair,
Time to shave, shave it off, it off.
No time for romantic escape,
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape. No!
No time for romantic escape,
When your fluffy heart is ready for ape. No!
Off we go.

You're sitting in your comfort you don't believe I'm real,
You cannot buy protection from the way that I feel.
Your progressive hypocrites hand out their trash,
But it was mine in the first place, so I'll burn it to ash.
And I've tasted all the strongest meats,
And laid them down in coloured sheets.
Laid them down in coloured sheets.
Who needs illusion of love and affection
When you're out walking in the streets with your mainline connection?
Connection.

As I cuddled the porcupine
He said I had none to blame, but me.
Held my heart, deep in hair,
Time to shave, shave it off, it off.
No time for romantic escape,
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape. No!
... No time.

Demon John

Say farewell
G'night, Sonny-Jim
In your defenseless
Winning smile
What do you hope to win?
And bliss face down, defended

Well, now stoned Demon John
There's no town the boy cannot belong
Why did you come here?
Is it to excavate all your sins?
Boil within?
Slaughter like the daughter of the devil you send me
I have to deal, you called me here

You couldn't say that you were juiced
The night that you were introduced
To Demon John
Gonna take him with you when you go?
Dance down slow
Oh, way down

You cannot escape the bar-side angel dissector
You undo your life with too much cocoon
Who's your protector?
Dark is the city where the white girls walk by
Down below your eyes, just like fireflies
You call me here, come on here, follow me dear
Past cascades of rage and fear
You called me here

You couldn't say that you had been juiced
The time that you were introduced
To Demon John
Well, you knew you had to want to go
Dance down slow
By the light of the sun
Murder comes
Today or tonight
Better get yourself together
And transcend it, a burst of light
Blaze stars into me
While the love breaks through here and now
So, murder by the light of the sun

Please, don't get too close to me
You said you are for real, it's not pretend
All memories stolen, know this for yourself
How would you like to be the happiest man in the world?
Behind the weathered field hands
Whose blistered paws Harvest cut
For wedding clothes they'll never wear
Marching down a road that was never there
It takes place on a sunlit lace and the backbone broken
Please bring us light
Demon John
You Demon John
Take him with you
When you go.

Your Flesh Is So Nice

I want to tell you a story
About a little cutey
She's ass-slappin' pretty
And voluptuous fingers
Wanna let her lick me
Stick the thick of my pussy
And as I cross the street
She looks good enough to eat me

Kitty!
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is nice
Your flesh is nice
Let me take a bite
Flesh is so nice

Oh, I take off my belt
Oh, I whip the staircase
Whip the staircase
Oh, kill all the men
Everything's dead to them
You're the only one I follow
Come on and let me give you that 'O'

Flesh is nice
Your flesh is so
I wanna take you twice
Your flesh is nice
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is nice

Your flesh is nice
Wanna take a bite
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so nice
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is nice
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is nice
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is nice

Jewel Box

I know you're a woman
By the way you burn below
I'll tell you secrets so good
You'll never tell a soul
Come closer, that bonfire holds his life like stones
My years, my life unknown

Diamonds from the pavement
Where a broken glass had been
Just like these troubles that I'm leaving to the wind
Like sapphires in boxcars speeding towards the end
Like thieves, my bad luck grows

Jewel box of sadness
Bring to catch your tear
Crystalize illusion shine forgot I'm here
Jewel box of sadness
Bring to catch your tear
Oh, you left some stars in my belly

Star crossed child's love on the bands of wedding gold
Silver studs of promise hide in the red crushed velvet folds
Inaction, intention, like emeralds I stole
My speech of custom gold
I think I ought to know

Jewel box of sadness
Bring to catch your tears
Crystalize illusion shine, forgot I'm here
Jewel box of sadness
Bring to catch your tear
Oh, you left some stars in my belly
You left some stars in my belly
You left some star in my belly.

Satisfied Mind

How many times have you heard someone say,
"If I had money, I would do things my way,"
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind?

Money can't buy back all your youth when you're old,
A friend when you're lonely, or peace to your soul.
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times,
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind.

When my life is over, and my time has run out,
My friends and my loved ones, I will leave, there's no doubt
But one thing's for certain: when it comes my time,
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.

One thing's for certain: when it comes my time,
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind, mind, mind, mind, mind,
Satisfied mind.

Gunshot Glitter

Don't you wanna let go of your heart
Or you resist the beds of bliss
Fortune makes fools of us all
My dear materialista, silence was insane,
The parting was mutual.
Don't you want the rocket to rock out?
There's room for us both to fly.
Tell the man I'm never coming back again.
Tell the man I'm never coming back again.
Why should you notice at all?
Gone again beside you will fall
Down to the sea out of the skies
Of gold cards and casual tears
I have only come to see you shine
Feminine smiles the right side is wise, more than I.
I wanna be your lover,
Lipstick my name across your mirror.
Blood red with flaked gunshot glitter
And be one with all you disowned in your young life. You paranoia politician diva.
You paranoia politician diva.

Will you let go of your heart,
Left behind a hypnotizing swirl
The semi's left behind.

Don't you want to rocket to rock?
There's room for both of us to fly
Same show everyday, don't have to blow up in the sky.
So I just came from Hicks town,
Left my coins behind
Maybe some poor cloths pony will buy himself a life
Why should you care if I crash your affair?
Why should you notice me? I really wanna see you shine.

I wanna be your lover,
Lipstick my name across your mirror.
Now, be one with all you disown,
True love has come to us all.
Blinded by the flame, right side smiles,
Organized male, love, my silence was insane.
The parting was mutual the moment I became
A paranoia politician
diva
A paranoia politician diva
A paranoia politician diva
A paranoia politician diva
Diva, diva, diva

Thousand Fold

I have no desire to make contact with all the thought of "no, no".
I shiver now, to think of how this answer asked her, no.
Long time gone. I run to my hide out.
There ain't a star born that brightens
More than you, you always should have known,
I'll illuminate your question,
Long time ago I'd died and gone.
What has brought the question?
Time has brought the question.
Come and call the question,
Oh, oh, oh.
Here are the stars, same thing again
Over, over, over, over, over, over
Over, over, over, over, over, over.

Morning Theft

Time takes care of the wound
So I can believe
You had so much to give
You thought I couldn't see

Gifts for boot heels to crush
Promises deceived
I had to send it away
To bring us back again

Your eyes and body brighten
Silent waters, deep
Your precious daughter in the
Other room, asleep

A kiss "Goodnight" from every
Stranger that I meet
I had to send it away
To bring us back again

Morning theft
Unpretender left
Ungraceful

True self is what
Brought you here, to me
A place where we can
Accept this love

Friendship battered down by
Useless history
Unexamined failure

But what am I still to you
Some thief who stole from you?
Or, some fool drama queen
Whose chances were few?

That brings us to who we need
A place where we can save
A heart that beats as
Both siphon and reservoir

You're a woman, I'm a calf
You're a window, I'm a knife
We come together
Making chance in the starlight

Meet me tomorrow night
Or any day you want
I have no right to wonder
Just how, or when

You know the meaning fits
There's no relief in this
I miss my beautiful friend

I have to send it away
To bring her back again.

Vancouver

Lady
All the troubles are my fright, I disgust you
Feel the power you cut the truth into you
Why do you think I'd hidden out on this rely
I could kiss you
With lines of escape in my mouth

Please let me bring back these gifts of mine to the woman
His eyes shined on my back as I slept and knew you
You didn't leave it all
You made an even call
My belly released the stars
And tears between the scars. Ooooh
We're where we belong
It should end here
Until the end of time
Beyond the moment
That ends our bondage
I am your failed husband contender
I'm your loan shark of bliss.

This dream you've ridden on
Turns your world to explosions
You need to be alone
To heal this bleeding stone
Now, smell the rain of London it still insists
That we beg for our purity
As if we are pure in the rain of our contentment
As if I can think of this no more.

You and I

You and I
Ah, the calm below that poisoned the river wild
You and I
Tears that dry on a rude awakened child
Where you look down
I've walked before
Burning holes
With eyes of liquid brown
If we had only known
In a way
We wouldn't reach this ground
You were my only home
Silver eyes
I want to see you shine
And we will feel the weight
Fall away from us in time
Searching our past for the true
You and I, you and I, you and I
All for you
Where you think you'll fall
I adore you
Where you shut your soul
I will open for you
If we had only known
In a way
We'd never reach this ground
I'll know
Silver eyes
I can see us shine
I said, we will feel the weight
Fall away from us in time
Searching our past for a true
You and I, you and I, you and I
All for you.

I Woke Up In A Strange Place

Ghost calls to visit
With my keys in his pocket
Kisses in my mouth with his
Eyes hanging out of his sockets
My memories crumble
Under still resistance
I was torn out like pages
From the book of existence

I woke up in a strange place
My mind a blur and some blood on my chin
I made a call for a blackened cab
Some destination was moving on in
I remember the words that you told me
How they come down so hard, so plain
Fate is going to find your love in a
Glass of champagne

I lied to my host i told him
I knew how far i could go
When i emptied my guts out
On his brand new stereo
Well he paid me to go upstairs
And spend a night with his friend
I never want to see my face
In the mirror again

I woke up in a strange place
Music so loud that i spilled all my beer
I met a ride in that blackened cab
Some destination was all that he had
Easy now, this car is speeding up
For my last chance, crashing to freedom
Fate is going to find your love in a
Glass of champagne

Sweat pours down
You're in the back seat sleeping
And she waits by the window
On an empty bed, weeping
The ghost guns the motor
To the land that he promised me
I guess this is the time when your
Best intentions become facts again

This is no song for the dislocated
The one you loved but it turned to be hated
Because the lies of the spirit possessed you
Because the eyes of your lover resist you
Listen now, you keep your aim steady
As your temple turns to kiss the pistol
Fate is going to find your love
In a glass of champagne

Fate is going to find your love
In a glass of champagne

Lilac Wine

I lost myself on a cool damp night
Gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see
and be what I want to be
When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because (it) brings me back you...

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me... I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she coming to me nearly here?
Lilac wine is sweet and heady where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?
Lilac Wine, I feel unready for my love...

What Will You Say

It's been such a long time
And I was just a child then
What will you say
When you see my face?
Time feels like it's flown away
The days just pass and fade away
What will you say
When they take my place?

It's funny now
I just don't feel like a man
What will you say
When you see my face?
My face...

Mother dear, the world's gone cold
No one cares about love anymore
What will you say
When you see my face?

Father do you hear me?
Do you know me?
Do you even care?
What will you say
When they take my place?

My heart can't take this anymore
What will you say
When you see my face?
When you see my,
See my face...

I can feel your time crawling
To a slow end
I can feel my time crawling
To a slow end...

Mother dear, the world's gone cold
No one cares about love anymore
What will you say
When you see my face?

Father do you hear me?
Do you know me?
Did you even care?
What will you say
When you take my place?

Well it's so funny now
I just don't feel like I'm a man
What will you say?

Moodswing Whiskey

Mood swing whiskey
Drank it all in the morning
Waiting for the dark to move in
Sitting in my step-sister's kitchen
Horseflies on the window sill
Eyes trained on the lemon king
And wishing it were a gun

I'm thinking of our wedding rings
Trapped inside the heater
Spring water on the floor of this
Sex starved room

The nightmare's fires burn
The waves of bliss
I tried to stop it with my hand
I was lost in the kiss
With you

Mood swing whiskey
Your bliss, the actress,
Bliss, the assassin
Bliss, the abyss

Did a crazy shot of whiskey
In about zero to sixty
All i could see was the beer

I face the future with a drink in my right
Eyes to the sparkling gloom
Body naked, afraid, and amazed

Say boost me up to your junkyard paradise
Boost me up to your junkyard paradise
With a sweet-ass photo of you

She cheated, and she lied, and you stole her
Stung my tongue just like
Sweat from her shoulder

Ooh, mood swing whiskey
Your love, the destroyer
Love, the destroyer
Love, love...

Yes mood swing whiskey has my brain
Only you can break this chain
Are you here in my bed again
Can you hear my love again

Run down the subway station babe
I'm packing my rod
All and present histories erased
I am a punishing god
Mood swing whiskey
Yeah the leaves are made of
Messy things again

And i said this is all the headless acrobats
Faces crushed in the circus dust
All for the law of gravity
And the price of admission

Beautiful loser warm hearts have let you down
Beautiful loser warm hearts have left you
Oh no, you...

I think of mankind in quotation marks
Ever since i took a drink from you
This is for all the headless acrobats
Faces crushed in the circus dust
All in the name of gravity
And the price of admission

Beautiful loser while eyes have let you now
Beautiful loser while eyes have let you now
Cause you're beautiful

I think of mankind in quotation marks
Ever since I took a drink of you

The Man That Got Away

The night is bitter
The stars have lost their glitter
The winds grow colder
And suddenly you're older
And all because of the man that got away.

No more his eager call
The writing's on the wall
The dreams you dreamed have all
gone astray.

The man that won you
Has gone off and undone you.
That great beginning
Has seen the final inning.
Don't know what happened. It's all a crazy game!

No more that all time thrill
For you've been through the mill
And never a new love will
be the same.

Good riddance, goodbye!
Every trick of his you're on to
But fools will be fools
And where's he gone to?

The road gets rougher
It's lonelier and tougher.
With hope you burn up
Tomorrow he may turn up
There's just no let up the live-long night and day.

Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman looking for
The man that got away...
The man that got away.

Kanga Roo

When i first saw you
You had on blue jeans
Your eyes couldn't hide
Anything
I saw you
Breathing, oh
Saw you staring out in space

When i next saw you
You were at the party
Thought you was a queen
Oh, so flirty
I came against them

Didn't say excuse
Knew what i was doing
We looked very fine
As we were leaving
As we were making
What we were making

Saint John
You were a cool jerk
Oh, i want you
Like a kangaroo

Just Like A Woman

Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Ev'rybody knows
That Baby's got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls.
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
Buy she breaks just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess
That Baby can't be blessed
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls.
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl.

It was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what's worse
Is this pain in here
I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear that --

I just can't fit
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
When we meet again
Introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world.
Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do
You make love just like a woman, yes, you do
Then you ache just like a woman
But you break just like a little girl.

Everyday People

Sometimes I'm right others are wrong
My own beliefs are in my song
The butcher, the baker, the drummer and then
Makes no difference 'bout what group I'm in

I am everyday people, yeah yeah

There is a blue one, that won't accept the green one
For living with a fat one, trying to be a skinny one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee
Oh sha sha, we got to live together

I am no better and neither are you
We are the same whatever we do
You love me, you hate me, you know me and then
You can't figure out the bag I'm in

I am everyday people, yeah yeah

There is a long hair, that doesn't like the short hair
For bein' such a rich one, that will not help the poor one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee
Oh sha sha, we got to live together

There is a yellow one, that won't accept the black one
That won't accept the red one, that won't accept the white one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee
Oh sha sha

I am everyday people
Yeah, yeah

We got to live together

Don't Let The Sun Catch You Cryin'

Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Cryin' at my front door
There you've done daddy dirty
He sure don't want you no more

Don't let the sun catch you lyin'
Lyin' at my front door
Daddy's done turned salty
And baby, you've made him so sore

You can cry, cry, cry
Yes baby, you can wail
Beat your head on the pavement
Till the man comes and throws you in jail

But don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Cryin' at my front door
You've done your daddy dirty
He sure don't want you no more

You can cry, cry, cry
Yes baby, you can wail
Beat your head on the pavement
Till the man comes and throws you in jail

But don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Cryin' at my front door
You've done your daddy dirty
He sure don't want you no more

When the moon goes down in the dawning
And the sun comes up in the morning
don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Cause daddy don't want you no more

Calling You

A desert road from Vegas to nowhere
Some place better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixing
In a little cafe just around the bend

I am calling you
Can't you hear me
I am calling you

A hot dry wind blows right thru me
Your baby's crying and I can't sleep
But we all know a change is coming
Coming closer sweet release

I am calling you
I know you hear me
I am calling you Oh

Dream Of You And I

This is, uh
Based on some music that I heard in a dream
That I saw in a dream
Called, it's going to be called "you and I", ouch!
'Cause it's what the people in the dream were saying

You and I, you and I, you and I
All for you

It's like that, I heard the people singing that in a dream
Yeah, and it was a dream where I was in an auditorium at a college
And everybody was congregated and singing the same words
And there was this, y'know a bunch of
This band on stage and they were like, y'know, sorta spacey Deadhead band
With teen- y'know, like, guys in their twenties, like a bunch of grunge guys but
Kinda playing this, this, other thing, not like what I'm playing here on guitar
And the people kept on beating out, uh
Rhythms on drumsticks
This really great rhythm, it was in like, seven four, this really cool space jam
And what it was, it was a song
I dreamed that this song was about, uh, about this guy, uh
Or, y'know, the person in the song is singing to his lover
Supposedly
That uh, y'know, he's completely theirs
The lover has forbidden anybody to have contact with him
The lover has taken away his freedom, taken away his days and nights
Taken away his, y'know, his dreams
Uh, sent away his friends
Forbidden him to, y'know, get close to his parents, all that stuff
And what it was, it was an AIDS rally
And that song was about AIDS
Or about something like that
So every time the refrain came around
The people would say "you and I, you and I, you and I"
And they point to the sign that said, y'know, like,
it said AIDS with a circle with a slash through it
And they go "all for you"
They go like, point to the sign, so that was the dream
I woke up with it
'Kay?
Anyway, as long as you got that on tape, I'll remember that

The Boy With The Thorn In His Side

The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A murderous desire for love... love

How can they look into my eyes
And still they don't believe me?
How can they hear me say those words
And still they don't believe me?

And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever believe me?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A plundering desire for love... love love love

How can they look into our eyes
And still they don't believe us?
And after all this time
They don't want to believe us

And if they don't believe us now
Will they ever believe us?
And when you want to live
How do you start?
Where do you go?
Who do you need to know?
Oh oh oh oh

Night Flight

I received a message from my brother across the water
He sat laughin' as he wrote the end's in sight
So I said goodbye to all my friends
And packed my hopes inside a matchbox
'Cause I know it's time to fly

Come on, meet me in the morning,
meet me in the middle of the night
The morning light is comin',
don't it make you wanna go and feel alright

I just jumped a train that never stops,
So now somehow I'll know I never finished payin' for my ride
Just n' someone pushed a gun into my hand
Tell me I'm the type of man to fight the fight that I'll require

Come on, meet me in the morning,
meet me in the middle of the night
The morning light is comin',
don't it make you wanna go and feel alright

Oh, mama, well I think it's time I'm leavin'
Nothin' here to make me stay
Whoa, mama, well it must be time I'm goin'
They're knockin' down them doors
They're tryin' to take me away

Please Mr. Brakeman, won't you ring your bell.
And ring loud and clear
Please Mr. Fireman, won't you ring your bell
Tell the people they got to fly away from here

I once saw a picture of a lady with a baby
Southern lady, had a very, very special smile
We are in the middle of a change in destination
When the train stops, all together we will smile
Oh, meet me in the morning.
Won't you meet me in the middle of the night, night, night
Everybody know the mornin' time is comin'
Don't it make you wanna feel alright. Ah, ah, yeah
Make me feel alright. Fly now, baby
Get to fly, yeah. Fly now, baby
